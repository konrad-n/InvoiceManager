# InvoiceManager

InvoiceManager is a web-based application designed to help accountants and business owners manage invoices efficiently. The application simplifies invoice creation, tracking, and management, making financial administration more streamlined.

## Current State

The application is currently built with ASP.NET Core 2.0 and uses Razor Pages for its UI. While functional, the codebase could benefit from upgrades to modern frameworks and software engineering practices. The application allows users to:

- Create, view, update, and delete invoices
- Filter invoices by date
- Assign invoices to specific accountants
- Track invoice status (Submitted, Approved)

## Refactoring

This project was created 7 years ago and needs modernization. The primary goals for refactoring are:

1. Upgrade to newer .NET Core versions
2. Implement clean architecture patterns
3. Improve code testability
4. Enhance separation of concerns
5. Apply modern software engineering practices
